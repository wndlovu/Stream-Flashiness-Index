The data represent estimates of nitrogen and phosphorus from commercial farm fertilizer annually for the years 1987 to 2012, and nitrogen and phosphorus application from farm animal manure (cattle, hogs/pigs, chickens, turkeys, sheep, and horses) for five year periods from 1982 to 2012.</abstract><purpose>These data are intended as support for research efforts using the USGS GAGES-II sites.</purpose><supplinf>This dataset is in support of study sites in the GAGES-II dataset (Falcone, 2011) and based on the watershed boundaries published there. These data were all derived from county-level data transformed into rasters by allocating the county statistics to land use pixels from the NAWQA Wall-to-Wall Anthropogenic Landuse Trends (NWALT) dataset (Falcone, 2015) in a consistent way (see Process Description). The county-level data themselves were derived from slightly different sources for different years, but believed to be reasonably consistent as a time series. For fertilizer the county data for 1987-2006 were from Gronberg and Spahr (2012), and for 2007-2012 from Brakebill and Gronberg (2017).  For manure the county data for 1982-1987 were from Ruddy and others (2006), for 2002 from Mueller and Gronberg (2013), and for 2007-2012 from Gronberg and Arnold (2017).

The source data for fertilizer were taken from Gronberg and Spahr (2012) for 1987-2006, and from Brakebill and Gronberg (2017) for 2007-2012. (Brakebill and Gronberg (2017) also contain data for 1987-2006, but they are an exact copy of the Gronberg and Spahr (2012) data). Only the farm fertilizer data were used for this Data Release (non-farm tabular data also exist in those datasets). County-level tabular source data for manure were taken from Ruddy and others (2006) for 1982-1997, from Mueller and Gronberg (2013) for 2002, and from Gronberg and Arnold (2017) for 2007-2012.  One county, Broomfield County, Colorado was a new county created in 2001 from parts of four other counties (Adams, Boulder, Jefferson, and Weld). For this dataset, the values for Broomfield for the years from 2002 to 2012 were apportioned back to those four counties according to the proportion of the area from each that made up Broomfield. Broomfield was thus not mapped as a separate entity in this dataset, but is part of the prior counties.  Broomfield is one of the smallest counties in the United States, however (99% of counties are larger), and the effect of this is minor in any case.</procdesc><procdate>20170211</procdate></procstep><procstep><procdesc>(2) The tabular data separately for fertilizer and manure were joined by FIPS code to a 2000-era county boundary polygon shapefile obtained from the National Historical Geographic Information System (NHGIS, nhgis.org).  Although it is recognized that in addition to Broomfield county, a small number of counties have also had minor boundary changes since 1987, these were believed to have minimal or no effect for the purpose of this dataset. A known FIPS change to Miami-Dade county was already adjusted for in the source data. The county shapefile was converted to a 1-km raster dataset.</procdesc><procdate>20170426</procdate></procstep><procstep><procdesc>(3) A series of rasters were created which allocated county-level values from the source data to land use pixels of crops and pasture/hay for farm fertilizer and manure.  This was done separately, but in the same manner, for fertilizer and manure, creating a time series of national rasters for each.  This was done using the Wall-to-wall Anthropogenic Landuse Trends (NWALT) dataset (Falcone, 2015), and is described in step 4, below.</procdesc><procdate>20170426</procdate></procstep><procstep><procdesc>(4) The county tabular data for each time series (fertilizer and manure) were allocated to pixels classified as Crops and Pasture/Hay (classes 43 and 44, collectively dubbed "Agriculture" here) from the NWALT dataset (Falcone, 2015).  The NWALT is a series of decadal raster datasets from 1974-2012 which map land use at 60-meters (m) for the conterminous U.S. Allocating the county tabular data to only areas where that activity was likely to have occurred improves the spatial mapping of the data.  Specifically, this was done as follows:
(a) Each of the NWALT land use raster datasets was resampled to 1-km, and the percent of each type of land use for each pixel was calculated, resulting in a fraction from 0 to 1. So, for example, a pixel for which 82% of the area was calculated as Agricultural use would have a value of 0.82, or 0.82 sq km.
(b) Each pixel’s proportion of the county’s total agricultural use was calculated.  For example, if the county had 100 sq km of agricultural use, the above pixel would represent .0082 of the total county use (0.82 / 100).
(c) The county values in units of kilograms (kg) of nitrogen (N) or phosphorus (P) were then multiplied by that fraction for each pixel.  For example, if the county had 500 kg of N for the year in question, the value assigned to the example pixel would be (500 * 0.0082) = 4.1, that is, 4.1 kg of N from farm fertilizer estimated for that 1-km pixel.  The NWALT dataset closest in time to the year of the county data was used for each year of the tabular fertilizer or manure data: for 1982 the 1982 NWALT was used; for 1987-1996, the 1992 NWALT was used; for 1997-2006, the 2002 NWALT was used; for 2007-2012, the 2012 NWALT was used.  This had the effect of apportioning the county statistic more accurately, rather than using a single year's land use raster.
(d) A check was performed to ensure that the sum of kg within each county matched the original tabular value, that is, 500 kg in the above example.  Minor differences may exist because of the spatial resolution of the 1-km raster datasets. For these rasters, 99% of counties matched the original values to within 5% agreement for both fertilizer and manure. The counties which had poorer agreement typically had small values in the source data, and thus had little effect on the overall mapping in any case. The raster datasets are stored as floating point ESRI Arc grids. 
This resulted in a series of 1-km raster datasets for which the original county statistics were allocated to feasible areas of the landscape, that is, areas which are reasonably likely to have farm fertilizer or manure from farm animals. The datasets are designed as a source of information for calculating watershed statistics.</procdesc><procdate>20170426</procdate></procstep><procstep><procdesc>(5) Calculations were then made from the grids described above. Watershed averages were calculated using the "run_zonal.aml" script developed by Curtis Price of the U.S. Geological Survey. This tool calculated zonal statistics from raster datasets.</procdesc><procdate>20170428</procdate></procstep></lineage></dataqual><eainfo><detailed Name="N-P_manure_1982-2012.txt, N-P_fertilizer_1987-2012.txt"><enttyp><enttypl>Attribute Tables for nitrogen and phosphorus from farm fertilizer and manure, N-P_manure_1982-2012.txt, N-P_fertilizer_1987-2012.txt.</enttypl><enttypd>Data consist of comma-separated text files</enttypd><enttypds>U.S. Geological Survey</enttypds></enttyp><attr><attrlabl>STAID</attrlabl><attrdef>Unique station identification number</attrdef><attrdefs>Corresponds to unique station identifier in GAGES-II</attrdefs><attrdomv><udom>Unique identifier for site</udom></attrdomv></attr><attr><attrlabl>N_MANURE_XXXX</attrlabl><attrdef>Watershed mean nitrogen from farm animal manure, for year XXXX (1982-2012)</attrdef><attrdefs>U.S. Geological Survey</attrdefs><attrdomv><rdom><rdommin>0.0</rdommin><rdommax>16095.1</rdommax><attrunit>Kilograms per square kilometer</attrunit></rdom></attrdomv></attr><attr><attrlabl>P_MANURE_XXXX</attrlabl><attrdef>Watershed mean phosphorus from farm animal manure, for year XXXX (1982-2012)</attrdef><attrdefs>U.S. Geological Survey</attrdefs><attrdomv><rdom><rdommin>0.0</rdommin><rdommax>6145.7</rdommax><attrunit>Kilograms per square kilometer</attrunit></rdom></attrdomv></attr><attr><attrlabl>N_FERT_FARM_XXXX</attrlabl><attrdef>Watershed mean nitrogen from farm applications of commercial fertilizer, for year XXXX (1987-2006)</attrdef><attrdefs>U.S. Geological Survey</attrdefs><attrdomv><rdom><rdommin>0.0</rdommin><rdommax>32162.7</rdommax><attrunit>Kilograms per square kilometer</attrunit></rdom></attrdomv></attr><attr><attrlabl>P_FERT_FARM_XXXX</attrlabl><attrdef>Watershed mean phosphorus from farm applications of commercial fertilizer, for year XXXX (1987-2006)</attrdef><attrdefs>U.S. Geological Survey</attrdefs><attrdomv><rdom><rdommin>0.0</rdommin><rdommax>3331.2</rdommax><attrunit>Kilograms per square kilometer</attrunit></rdom></attrdomv></attr></detailed></eainfo><distinfo><distrib><cntinfo><cntorgp><cntorg>US Geological Survey - ScienceBase</cntorg></cntorgp><cntaddr><addrtype>Mailing</addrtype><address>Denver Federal Center, Building 810, Mail Stop 302</address><city>Denver</city><state>CO</state><postal>80225</postal><country>USA</country></cntaddr><cntvoice>1-888-275-8747 (1-888-ASK-USGS)</cntvoice><cntemail>sciencebase@usgs.gov</cntemail></cntinfo></distrib><distliab>Although this data set has been used by the U.S. Geological
